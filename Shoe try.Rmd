### Explain Variables
`sporting_goods`: Monthly Seasonally Adjusted Sales (in Millions of Dollars) in Advance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services: U.S. Total

`monthly_retail`: Monthly Seasonally Adjusted Sales (in Millions of Dollars) in Sporting Goods, Hobby, Musical Instrument, and Book Stores: U.S. Total

`sp_index`: the index comprises stocks in the S&P total market index that are classified as in the GICS retail sub-industry


```{r visualizations, echo=FALSE, dpi=300}
shoe_data <- read.csv("data/shoe_final.csv")


#We'll look at the total sales per month and the cumulative sum for each brand over time
sales_dollars = shoe_data %>%
  group_by(brand, Year_month) %>%
  summarise(monthly_sales = sum(sale_price))
sales_dollars = sales_dollars %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  mutate(total_sales = cumsum(monthly_sales))


ggplot(sales_dollars) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year_month,y=monthly_sales, group = brand, color = brand))

ggplot(sales_dollars) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year_month,y=total_sales, group = brand, color = brand))


# Next we'll look at total sales volume (number of orders) per month as well as cumulative orders over time.

sales_vol = shoe_data %>%
  group_by(brand, Year_month) %>%
  summarise(monthly_orders = n())
sales_vol = sales_vol %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  mutate(total_orders = cumsum(monthly_orders))

ggplot(sales_vol) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year_month,y=monthly_orders, group = brand, color = brand))

ggplot(sales_vol) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year_month,y=total_orders, group = brand, color = brand))



```

We see a spike in orders during the holidays for both brands. The bulk of the orders as well as sales dollars comes from Yeezys most likely because the Adidas Yeezy shoes are cheaper on the resale market than the more exclusive Nike Off-White shoes.

```{r visualizations2, echo=FALSE, dpi=300}
shoe_data$resale_premium = shoe_data$sale_price - shoe_data$retail_price
shoe_data$resale_premium_percent = 100*(shoe_data$resale_premium / shoe_data$retail_price)

brand_premium = shoe_data %>%
  group_by(brand, Year_month) %>%
  summarise(average_premium = mean(resale_premium_percent))

ggplot(brand_premium) +
  geom_line(aes(x=Year_month,y=average_premium, group = brand, color = brand))

```
For Yeezys, buyers typically paid a ~200% premium for resale while Off-White buyers paid on average ~600%. For both brands the resale prices cooled off, but the Off-White shoes still demanded a much higher average premium throughout. We think this is the case because Adidas tends to restock their shoes much more frequently to the point where some shoes like the `adidas-Yeezy-Boost-350-V2-Butter` or the `Adidas-Yeezy-Boost-350-V2-Cream-White` resell for less than their retail price.
